                </a></h2>
                <p>This capstone project is from the Google Data Analytics Certification Course offered by Coursera and accredited by Google.
                    In this case study, I will be working as a data analyst for CYCLISTIC, a bike-share company.

The company is based in Chicago, USA and has over 5,800 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.</p>
